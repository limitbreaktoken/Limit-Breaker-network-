## ðŸ”’ Whitepaper Concept â€” For Those Who Still Dream

This document is a concept â€” an idea built with passion, not money.  
It is for those who wanted to create something like Bitcoin but never got the chance.  
No team. No funding. Just thought and effort.

The whitepaper introduces a unique address generation logic, new prefix format,  
and a 512-bit extended private key mechanism â€” all aimed at pushing limits.

I am not building this right now.  
But if you're someone who understands the value of raw ideas, this is for you.

You are free to explore, fork, build â€” or just think.

**Some ideas are left behind, not because theyâ€™re weak, but because the world wasnâ€™t ready.**
